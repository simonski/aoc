Puzzle: Proboscidea Volcanium
Year: 2022
Day: 16

Before I read it, I want to say to myself - I am enjoying this year much more.  The first ten(?) days were I think toy problems to stretch the fingers I suppose.  I could have used those to learn some rust or, - well, whateger.

As we got past maybe D12, it got more involved - the demon on my shoulder telling me I'm no good was beginning to be fed, so I had a word with myself and said: why are you doing this? it's supposed to be fun, not a pressured win/lose.  

This means that the days 14/15 which took > 24hours, I do still mind and feel a failure, but I don't mind so much.  so what that it took my more than eleventy seconds. The point is I aimed to solve them and I did. I think Cryptonomicon has a mention of Newton saying to Enoch something along the lines of - "what matters is that you did understand the calculus, not that you didn't discover it."   So, I could be Enoch and happy.  At least - was that Enoch? or maybe it was the other guy.  Time to reread Cryptonomicon - it is Christmas break after all (in a week).

Also - blogging (or writing) might be a good thing.
