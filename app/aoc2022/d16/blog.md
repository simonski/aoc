Before I read it, I want to say to myself - I am enjoying this year much more.  The first ten(?) days were I think toy problems to stretch the fingers I suppose.  I could have used those to learn some rust or, - well, whateger.

As we got past maybe D12, it got more involved - the demon on my shoulder telling me I'm no good was beginning to be fed, so I had a word with myself and said: why are you doing this? it's supposed to be fun, not a pressured win/lose.  

This means that the days 14/15 which took > 24hours, I do still mind and feel a failure, but I don't mind so much.  so what that it took my more than eleventy seconds. The point is I aimed to solve them and I did. I think Cryptonomicon has a mention of Newton saying to Enoch something along the lines of - "what matters is that you did understand the calculus, not that you didn't discover it."   So, I could be Enoch and happy.  At least - was that Enoch? or maybe it was the other guy.  Time to reread Cryptonomicon - it is Christmas break after all (in a week).

Also - blogging (or writing) might be a good thing.

1 coffee later and a read of the problem.

I like this problem.  I'm going to attempt to blog my thoughts along the way - I haven't written the blogging engine but why shoudl that stop me from writing the content - no software required for that :).   It's' *really* cold outside minus 4 I think.  

Ok so I think this problem is a tree, the paths are a set of values.  I think I 
- build the tree
- walk the paths to find the "best". 

So if my aim is to 1. solve and 2. *undertand*, then I think that I should do it in two parts

1. write a tree (yes - I write it all from scratch - this is actuallt the *point*)
2. write a tree walker 

I can do 1. mostly.  I cannot remember tree walking properly, so I will consult Donald *before* I attempt the walking.
