First 10 days raced thgourh.  Next ten did not.  Key takeaways

- maybe don't rewrite EVERYTHING for each day
- There is a toolkit I should really have ready by now:
    - dijkstra, 
    - bfs, 
    - dfs, 
    - a* 

- Some preparatory maths is going to help me
     - LCM
     - GCD

- Some language stuff as well
    - array manipulation, array-of-array initialisation
    - bitwise operators and usage
    - test suites specifically 

Other things; my attempts take seconds-to-minutes.  Once I solve, I look at redditors attempts and they are very, very fast, milliseeconds.  So, this tells me for example I rely on brute force and string manipulation far too much.

My coding style is AllOverThePlace and all_over_the_place.  I should *really* settle.

3 dimensions.  I've always foun it hard.  So perhaps a general purpose visualisation language or toolkit.

Time to settle on a standardised Graph/Node/Point3D setup for 2023.. or previous years perhaps :)

Maybe each day should be a program rather than a function.
