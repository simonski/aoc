	entry.Title = "TDD to the rescue."
	entry.Notes = `Day four, 7am, 38mins. A visualisation is possible! I will try to go quickly, solviing with some TDD, present an ascii output then once complete go back and do a webpage vis.  Some notes:

	<p>
	I did a silly thing working out if it intersects so I started again. Not super keen on the <code>.Overlap()</code> and <code>.Intesect()</code> logic but it works and I'll live.
	</p>

	<p>
	TDD totally helped in solving it first time.
	
	<p>
	The visualisation is just the stdout of all as html - keep it simple.

	<p>
	As always, the tools (this blogging ahem, <i>engine></i> is now interesting to me).
	<ul>
	<li>code formatting or referencing somehow
	<li>inlining html in a sensible manner
	<li>putting teh blog entries into a separate file that is go:embed read at startup rather than using go structs and super-hardcoding the blog itself
	`
