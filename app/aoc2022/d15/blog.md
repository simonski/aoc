Puzzle: Beacon Exclusion Zone
Year: 2022
Day: 15

I had one attempt, got p1.  Didn't realise I was brute forcing it.  

The second attempt I woke up, thought about it as ranges of exclusion zones - I was trying to
work out a way to avoid scans where possible.  Ccame back on Saturday morning and redid both in about 2hrs (0730..0930)
