Puzzle: Trebuchet?!
Year: 2023
Day: 01

This was a **good** first problem.  The "two parts" approach in this case did ramp up in finickyness - uncertain how
to phrase the apprach.  A straight string replace was not quite the solution - it was in the end - but it obscured
the edge cases.  

I didn't expect the second part to ramp on day one like that - now I'm worried I'll cop out at the teens...

Overall time: probably 1hr end to end, owing to second part, train wifi, complications of logging in on phone via ID and on laptop via github, silly me, different inputs.
