--- Day 4: Ceres Search ---
"Looks like the Chief's not here. Next!" One of The Historians pulls out a device and pushes the only button on it. After a brief flash, you recognize the interior of the Ceres monitoring station!

As the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she'd like to know if you could help her with her word search (your puzzle input). She only has to find one word: XMAS.

This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It's a little unusual, though, as you don't merely need to find one instance of XMAS - you need to find all of them. Here are a few ways XMAS might appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with .:


..X...
.SAMX.
.A..A.
XMAS.S
.X....
The actual word search will be full of letters instead. For example:

MMMSXXMASM
MSAMXMSMSA
AMXSXMAAMM
MSAMASMSMX
XMASAMXAMM
XXAMMXXAMA
SMSMSASXSS
SAXAMASAAA
MAMMMXMMMM
MXMXAXMASX
In this word search, XMAS occurs a total of 18 times; here's the same word search again, but where letters not involved in any XMAS have been replaced with .:

  0123456789
1 ....XXMAS.
2 .SAMXMS...
3 ...S..A...
4 ..A.A.MS.X
5 XMASAMX.MM
6 X.....XA.A
7 S.S.S.S.SS
8 .A.A.A.A.A
9 ..M.M.M.MM
0 .X.X.XMASX

Take a look at the little Elf's word search. How many times does XMAS appear?
