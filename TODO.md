I got ChatGPT to scrape (sustainably!) all problems so I can offline solve them on 
some long-haul plane rides I have coming up.

### 2024-10-15
    Refactor all probkems to the new Puzzle class so that that stars etc work.

### 2023-01-02

Fix the `./start.sh` 
    - fetch the details
    - update the summary on that puzzle so I can blog it perhaps or set the start time?

Fix the getSummary etc. to return pre-2022 and post-2022 via different methods.  Iterate over time to
each y2023/d01/ style.  Learn how (or not) to reflect instances.

Fix ALL days down to their own package yXXXX/dXX/
