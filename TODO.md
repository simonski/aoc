# AOC TODO

AOC 2021

- finish the tempalte off - code, test, data files.
- update all code for completeness so List looks nice.
- update readme to figure out how to reflect on the app where we can drop the number of files down
    - I think I can make an application struct per year, then reflect directly on that perhaps?

This is my TODO list for AOC 2020.

- all days: code style, comments.
- day1 part1, sort and binchop
- day1 part2, go look at algos book again
