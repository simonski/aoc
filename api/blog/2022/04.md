Day four, 38mins, a visualisation is possible! I will try to go quick, solve with some TDD, present an ascii output then once complete go back and do a webpage vis.

I did a silly thing working out if it intersects so I started again.

TDD totally helped in solving it first time.

The visualisation is just the stdout of all as html - keep it simple.
